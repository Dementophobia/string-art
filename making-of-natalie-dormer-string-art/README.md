# Natalie Dormer String Art Portrait

This page is dedicated to my Natalie Dormer String Art portrait. If you want to know more about my creations, take a look at [Creating String Art](../README.md#creating-string-art).

## Specs of the Portrait

```
Canvas size:	70cm x 70cm
Nails per side:	150 nails
String used:	~3.500 meters of black sewing thread (one single string)
```

## Animation from start to finish

The following animation was made from the photos I took during the creation process. The color tone varies a little, because the light environment was not constant, as I was using daylight for illumination.

You can see me starting from a blank canvas, slowly working out the details of the portrait. Around the fourth or fifth photo you can start seeing basic shapes like eyes, nose and mouth appearing. At this stage, less than 500 meters of string have been used.

I kept refining the important details, without paying any attention to the background. The background was filled during the last phase, without significant impact on the face itself. This prioritization allowed me to focus on the key features of the image. The whole process, including the preparation of the canvas, took around 30 hours total, spread over several weeks.
